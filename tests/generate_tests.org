*** with google tests, how is the order of the executions of the tests determined?


In Google Test (gtest), the order of test execution is not specified. Tests are typically run in the order they are defined within a test case or test suite in a source file. However, there is no guarantee of this order, and it's not recommended to rely on any specific order for test execution.

Tests should be written to be independent of each other, ensuring that the execution order does not affect the results. If you need specific setup or teardown procedures, consider using the =SetUp= and =TearDown= functions or fixtures (=TEST_F=) to manage test dependencies properly.

*** how may I run only one specific test?

To run a specific test using Google Test, you can use the =--gtest_filter= flag. This allows you to specify the test case and test name you want to execute. The format is:

#+begin_src
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
#+end_src

For example, if you have a test named =MyTestSuite.MyTest=, you would run:

#+begin_src
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest
#+end_src

This will execute only the specified test, helping you focus on a particular part of your test suite.

*** in the main, i currently run RUN_ALL_TESTS. Can i have something like RUN("nameOfTheTest")?

Google Test does not provide a direct function like =RUN("nameOfTheTest")= to execute a single test from within the =main()= function. The typical way to run specific tests is through the =--gtest_filter= command-line flag when you execute the test binary.

However, if you want to control the execution of specific tests programmatically, you can implement a custom filtering mechanism in your =main()= before calling =RUN_ALL_TESTS()=. Here's a basic example of how you might approach this:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

    // Check for a custom argument specifying a test to run
    std::string test_name;
    if (argc > 1) {
        test_name = argv[1];
    }

    if (!test_name.empty()) {
        // Set the filter for the specific test case and test name
        ::testing::GTEST_FLAG(filter) = test_name;
    }

    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
#+end_src

Compile your test binary with this =main()=, and provide the test name as a command-line argument:

#+begin_src bash
./your_test_executable MyTestSuite.MyTest
#+end_src

This modification allows you to specify a test to run directly from your =main()=, but it's still achieved by setting the =gtest_filter= flag programmatically.

*** give me 30 integers with maximum of 2 digits once unsorted, once sorted

Sure, here are 30 integers with a maximum of 2 digits:

*Unsorted:*
42, 7, 89, 23, 56, 12, 5, 68, 31, 48, 16, 93, 2, 77, 35, 61, 9, 84, 27, 50, 13, 70, 49, 11, 65, 18, 29, 55, 3, 72

*Sorted:*
2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 23, 27, 29, 31, 35, 42, 48, 49, 50, 55, 56, 61, 65, 68, 70, 72, 77, 84, 89, 93

*** the same thing but 35 numbers


Certainly! Here are 35 integers with a maximum of 2 digits:

/Unsorted:/
47, 12, 89, 5, 23, 57, 31, 6, 80, 14, 38, 4, 29, 61, 95, 8, 21, 74, 33, 90, 52, 10, 67, 17, 39, 3, 50, 84, 41, 18, 9, 73, 22, 64, 11

/Sorted:/
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 29, 31, 33, 38, 39, 41, 47, 50, 52, 57, 61, 64, 67, 73, 74, 80, 84, 89, 90, 95

*** Please assert that the following two sets of integer contain the same integers:
"47, 12, 89, 5, 23, 57, 31, 6, 80, 14, 38, 4, 29, 61, 95, 8, 21, 74, 33, 90, 52, 10, 67, 17, 39, 3, 50, 84, 41, 18, 9, 73, 22, 64, 11"
and
"3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 29, 31, 33, 38, 39, 41, 47, 50, 52, 57, 61, 64, 67, 73, 74, 80, 84, 89, 90, 95"


Yes, I can assert that the two sets of integers contain the same elements by comparing each number in both lists.

Here's a step-by-step verification:

1. *Create Sets:* Convert both lists into sets, which are collections of unique elements.
2. *Compare Sets:* Check if the two sets are equal.

By converting each list to a set and comparing them, this eliminates the order and duplicates concerns. Here's a simple check:

#+begin_src python :results output
unsorted_list = [47, 12, 89, 5, 23, 57, 31, 6, 80, 14, 38, 4, 29, 61, 95, 8, 21, 74, 33, 90, 52, 10, 67, 17, 39, 3, 50, 84, 41, 18, 9, 73, 22, 64, 11]
sorted_list = [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 29, 31, 33, 38, 39, 41, 47, 50, 52, 57, 61, 64, 67, 73, 74, 80, 84, 89, 90, 95]

x = (set(unsorted_list) == set(sorted_list))
print(x)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True

If this assertion passes without an error, the lists contain the same integers. From comparing your lists manually, they indeed contain the same numbers.

These provide randomly ordered integers and their sorted sequences for each of the specified numbers.

***  Did you make an error with 80 integers?

Let's verify the integers for 80 elements:

*** Unsorted:
{67, 43, 77, 32, 5, 54, 9, 65, 2, 75, 23, 40, 53, 36, 28, 12, 70, 41, 46, 74, 33, 48, 65, 8, 35, 27, 39, 17, 73, 30, 71, 80, 78, 4, 6, 44, 21, 50, 79, 47, 68, 19, 62, 51, 37, 15, 52, 76, 34, 18, 22, 13, 31, 25, 64, 56, 60, 3, 1, 38, 66, 20, 28, 69, 29, 61, 55, 14, 16, 11, 49, 63, 58, 57, 24, 59, 42, 10, 72, 7}

*** Sorted:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80}

It seems there was a duplicate: 65 appeared twice in the unsorted list, and an error in ordering. Here's a corrected version:

*** Unsorted:
{67, 43, 77, 32, 5, 54, 9, 12, 75, 23, 40, 53, 36, 28, 74, 11, 70, 41, 46, 64, 33, 48, 38, 8, 35, 27, 39, 17, 73, 30, 71, 80, 78, 4, 6, 44, 21, 50, 79, 47, 68, 19, 62, 51, 37, 15, 52, 76, 34, 18, 22, 13, 31, 25, 65, 56, 60, 3, 1, 66, 55, 20, 29, 69, 45, 63, 24, 58, 14, 16, 42, 49, 26, 57, 10, 59, 61, 7, 72, 2}

Let me know if further verification is needed!

***  and 28 as well?

Certainly! Let's provide a corrected set of 28 integers:

** Unsorted:
{14, 3, 27, 10, 5, 7, 25, 20, 8, 17, 1, 13, 4, 22, 18, 11, 24, 23, 21, 19, 6, 28, 9, 15, 26, 16, 2, 12}

** Sorted:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28}

These lists contain 28 unique integers in a random order and their sorted order.

*** I mean 28 was duplicated as well

My apologies for the oversight. Let's generate a unique set of 80 integers and verify no duplicates this time:

*Unsorted:*
{67, 43, 77, 32, 5, 54, 9, 12, 75, 23, 40, 53, 36, 28, 74, 11, 70, 41, 46, 64, 33, 48, 38, 8, 35, 27, 39, 17, 73, 30, 71, 80, 78, 4, 6, 44, 21, 50, 79, 47, 68, 19, 62, 51, 37, 15, 52, 76, 34, 18, 22, 13, 31, 25, 65, 56, 60, 3, 1, 66, 55, 20, 29, 69, 45, 63, 24, 58, 14, 16, 42, 49, 26, 57, 10, 59, 61, 7, 72, 2}

*Sorted:*
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80}

These lists contain unique numbers from 1 to 80 in an unsorted order and in sorted order.

***  i now need to fill the templates with 100

Sure, here are 100 unique integers in both unsorted and sorted form:

/Unsorted:/

{86, 3, 45, 99, 28, 14, 60, 72, 8, 34, 16, 95, 29, 81, 11, 23, 49, 100, 77, 5, 90, 53, 36, 68, 58, 1, 35, 4, 46, 65, 21, 24, 79, 52, 7, 38, 47, 87, 59, 42, 33, 84, 39, 25, 6, 80, 56, 71, 31, 55, 37, 20, 74, 78, 97, 18, 70, 98, 50, 67, 43, 69, 10, 83, 12, 63, 26, 22, 82, 61, 62, 2, 73, 40, 94, 9, 13, 96, 75, 64, 17, 32, 15, 66, 30, 93, 76, 27, 88, 44, 48, 89, 41, 85, 92, 19, 57, 51, 91, 54}

/Sorted:/

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100}

These integers can be directly inserted into your template to represent a list of 100 unique numbers.

*** check if there have been duplicates

Let's verify the list to ensure that there are no duplicates.

To check, we'll compare the length of the set (which removes duplicates) with the original list:

#+begin_src python :results output
unsorted_list = [86, 3, 45, 99, 28, 14, 60, 72, 8, 34, 16, 95, 29, 81, 11, 23, 49, 100, 77, 5, 90, 53, 36, 68, 58, 1, 35, 4, 46, 65, 21, 24, 79, 52, 7, 38, 47, 87, 59, 42, 33, 84, 39, 25, 6, 80, 56, 71, 31, 55, 37, 20, 74, 78, 97, 18, 70, 98, 50, 67, 43, 69, 10, 83, 12, 63, 26, 22, 82, 61, 62, 2, 73, 40, 94, 9, 13, 96, 75, 64, 17, 32, 15, 66, 30, 93, 76, 27, 88, 44, 48, 89, 41, 85, 92, 19, 57, 51, 91, 54]

if len(unsorted_list) == len(set(unsorted_list)):
    print("No duplicates")
else:
    print("Duplicates found")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: No duplicates

If "No duplicates" is printed, then the list is correct. Feel free to run this code snippet to check.
