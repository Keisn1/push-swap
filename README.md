# Objects

## Set of IntValues

## Stack 1

## Stack 2

## Set of instructions

# Goal

-   program called `push_swap`

## Input

-   [2.1](#*Set of IntValues)

## Output

-   print on standard output
-   smallest program using Push_swap instruction language, to sort the
    integers

# Evaluation

-   only by human beings, therefore no restriction on orgranization

-   executable: `push_swap`

-   submit a `Makefile`

    -   must compile the project
    -   must contain usual rules

-   `libft` allowed with own `Makefile`

-   `normed`

-   no unexpected quit of program

-   no memory leaks

-   allowed functions

    -   write
    -   read
    -   malloc
    -   free
    -   exit

-   smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack

    -   will be compared to a maximum number of operations tolerated

-   will be checked with checker program

    ``` shell
    $>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG
    OK
    ```

    -   displays KO
    -   available in the resources of the project on the intranet

# Game Rules

## V1

### start

1.  a (stack)

    -   contianes random number of either positive of negative numbers
        without any `duplicates`

2.  b (stack)

    -   empty

### goal

-   sort numbers into stack a
-   ascending order

### operations

# The Program

## Execution

-   First argument at the top of the stack

``` shell
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```

## Display

-   smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack
    -   will be compared to a maimum number of operations tolerated
-   instructions must be seperated by '`\n`{=latex}'

## Error

-   display `Error` followed by a '`\n`{=latex}' on standard error
    -   ‚òê not integers
        -   bigger than integer
        -   duplicates
        -   characters
